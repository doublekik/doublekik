## Hi there 👋

<!--
**doublekik/doublekik** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on chains or lines of code that connect entriquitly, hopefully achieving a interactive editor no real purpose in mind 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, the functions of a cloud shell, and backend functions like bins and, git.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on developing algorithms, I've got some ideas that would seem completely random, when done correctly, operate similar to an engine using several different variables mostly waste type products, separately able to be remotely supervised or initiated.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with gaming type apps more for personal use though like stats and unlockables or hidden repeatable.
- 💬 Ask me about 🔏
- 📫 How to reach me: pull an issue and make me know.
- 😄 Pronouns: ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...
